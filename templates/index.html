<p>"Delta Xi became a Chapter of Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity on December 3rd, 2000. That Fall, University of Missouri Director of Expansion, Hoyt Craver, sent letters out to all MU students with at least a 3.0 GPA inviting them to attend a "Meet Phi Sigma Pi Night." The next night, all interested students attended the very first chapter meeting; thus, establishing and becoming the Founding Fathers of Delta Xi. Since then, Delta Xi has continued to grow and was recognized at the 2010 National Convention as one of the largest Chapters in the country. Since our recognition as a Chapter of Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity, Delta Xi has strived to uphold our tripod of ideals of Scholarship, Leadership, and Fellowship. We have actively volunteered in our community with organizations such as Cedar Creek Therapeutic Riding Center, Central Missouri Food Bank, the Humane Society, Clean-up Columbia, and many others. Additionally, we hold educational and social events such as meeting up as a group for dinner, a scavenger hunt similar to the "Amazing Race", trivia nights, trips to Venture Out, and much more." - Jerome Link, 2011-2012 Delta Xi Chapter President</p>
<p>"Being an out-of-state student, finding an organization that could provide a sense of home and family seemed like a long shot. Phi Sigma Pi has not only given me that but I've also gained an extended family that I have come to cherish. The brotherhood evident in our chapter in unquestionable and one of the defining characteristics of Delta Xi. I am so lucky to be a Brother and I will carry that with me long after I graduate." - Adia German"</p>
<p>â€Ž"Joining PSP was one of the best decisions I've made during my college career. I have gained leadership experience, many new friends, and the chance to serve my community in a more significant way." - Holden Spurrier</p>
